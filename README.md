# dotfiles repo

This is the repo that has all of my dotfiles from the various Linux programs that I use.

---

1. Vim - used as my main editor to complement my webdev workflow
2. Emacs - Occasionally used for code editing, but mainly for Org mode and LaTeX
3. Tmux - used as a part of my webdev workflow with Vim

---

All 3 of these programs use the base-16 color scheme with the same color profiles also being applied to Terminal.app and Konsole.

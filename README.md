# dotfiles repo

This is the repo that has all of my dotfiles from the various Linux programs that I use.

---

1. Vim - used as my main editor to complement my webdev workflow
2. Emacs - Occasionally used for code editing, but mainly for Org mode and LaTeX
3. Tmux - used as a part of my webdev workflow with Vim
4. Xresources - For setting the terminal colour scheme and for configuring URxvt
5. i3 - Default Window Manager on my Arch/Manjaro installs. Very minimal setup with custom colour scheme based on base16 default dark color scheme
6. i3status - The statusbar for i3, with very minimal modules to show necessary information

---

Vim, Emacs, and Tmux use the base16 default dark color scheme with the same color profiles also being applied to Terminal.app and Konsole.

I recently switched over to URxvt and i3wm, and am also using the same color scheme in my terminal and window manager.
